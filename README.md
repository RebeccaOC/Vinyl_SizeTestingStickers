# Cavalier Stickers 

Purchased really cheap heat transfer vinyl and wanted to test its limits. Created a detailed design of my dog and printed at three different sizes. 

Outcome: It cut great, but weeding was harder due to the cheaper, less tacky adhesive on the roll compared to more expensive brands. The smallest (1 inch) lost a few details during weeding, but the transwer worked well and survived 10 washes/dries. The roll will work great for less detailed work- saving me ~$20/roll.
